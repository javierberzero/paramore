         <p>Hayley Nichole Williams (born December 27, 1988) is an American singer and songwriter. She is the lead vocalist and only constant member of the rock band Paramore, which she co-founded in 2004.
            
            <br>
            Williams was born and raised in Meridian, Mississippi. Her parents divorced when she was 13 and she moved with her mother to Franklin, Tennessee, where she later formed Paramore alongside Josh Farro, Zac Farro, and Jeremy Davis. Paramore has released six studio albums: All We Know Is Falling (2005), Riot! (2007), Brand New Eyes (2009), Paramore (2013), After Laughter (2017), and This Is Why (2023). It has featured a continuously changing line-up (currently consisting of Williams, Zac Farro, and Taylor York) with Williams being the only member to appear on all six albums</p>
            <br>
        <p class="members-p">Williams' non-Paramore musical work includes the song "Teenagers" for the soundtrack of the film Jennifer's Body (2009) and collaborations with The Chariot, October Fall, New Found Glory, Set Your Goals, and Zedd. In 2010, she was featured on the single "Airplanes" by B.o.B, which peaked at No. 2 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. The sequel to the song, "Airplanes, Part II", featured new verses from B.o.B. and a guest verse from Eminem with Williams' vocals remaining. This gained a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. In 2023, she featured on Taylor Swift's re-recording of her 2010 album Speak Now on the track "Castles Crumbling". She has also released the solo EPs Petals for Armor I (2020) and Petals for Armor II (2020), the subsequent full-length solo album Petals for Armor (2020), and her second solo album Flowers for Vases / Descansos (2021).

        <p>Zachary Wayne Farro (born June 4, 1990)[6] is an American musician, best known as the drummer for the rock band Paramore. He is the younger brother of Josh Farro, who was Paramore's former lead guitarist and backing vocalist. After he and his brother exited Paramore in 2010, Josh formed a band named Novel American, which Zac was also a part of. Farro is currently the sole member of the band HalfNoise. Farro rejoined Paramore in 2016.[7]</p><br>
        <p class="members-p">Farro, at age 14, was a founding member of Paramore, created in Franklin, Tennessee in 2004. The lineup included Hayley Williams (lead vocals/keyboards), Farro (drums), his older brother Josh Farro (lead guitar and backing vocals), and Jeremy Davis (bass guitar). Jeremy Davis admitted he was initially unsure if the band could be taken seriously because of Zac's young age until he saw him play.[9] The band released three studio albums, All We Know Is Falling, Riot! and Brand New Eyes, as well as two live albums and one EP. Brand New Eyes, their third album, was released on September 29, 2009. In June 2009, the band welcomed Taylor York (rhythm guitar), a long time friend of the Farros' and who previously played with them as a touring member. On December 18, 2010, the band's website announced the Farros' amicable departure. On December 21, 2010, Josh Farro released an official exit statement for himself and his brother, refuting the band's previous story.[10]</p>

        <p>York had done backup vocals when he was younger for the band, before All We Know Is Falling.[9] He joined Paramore after the departure of Hunter Lamb in 2007 as their rhythm guitarist.[1] In the liner notes for the group's second album, Riot!, Hayley Williams, Josh Farro, and Zac Farro included him on their list of "thank yous". He also helped write "That's What You Get" and bonus track "Stop This Song", which his brother Justin York helped write.[10]</p>

            After the release of Riot!, Paramore released a live album, The Final Riot!. York was credited as a member of the band in the liner notes of the latter and was later officially acknowledged by Paramore as an official member on June 15, 2009. After Josh and Zac Farro left the band, Williams said that she was sure York would leave the band as well.[11] York said in interview: “When it went down, it was hard for me to make a decision. I just wasn't ready. I broke down, and started crying at one point, and I just knew that I wasn't done and that I loved being in a band with Jeremy and Hayley so much. I still had a lot more to do with the band, so I just looked forward and did it.”[12] Williams also stated that she was not that close to Taylor at the time. They finally met up for coffee after attending a show together, and Williams recalls crying in her car afterward and knew the band was going to be okay with York staying.</div>
